## TypeScript-properties

Redacrot of properties. Add, delete, change functional. First try of TypeScript

It gave me experience at the following points: 

- Basic types(number, string ...)
- Object structure typification
- Functions typification
- Types and Interfaces
- Components typification
- Unions
